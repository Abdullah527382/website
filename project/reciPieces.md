# reciPieces application

## Changelog

- Coming soon (hopefully not)

## Overview

We want to cut down on fast food expenditure and start learning to cook at home but whenever we try to cook something, we usually never have ingredients required to make the recipe.

This is where **_reciPieces_** comes in.
It is essentially a vanilla javascript based application which takes in a list of ingredients you currently have in your home and matches them with a recipe of your choice, but also listings of _cookable_ recipes based on current ingredients.

1. Ability to login, register if not registered, and log out
2. Ability to add a recipe
3. Ability to add current ingredients you own
4. Ability to display current ingredients
5. Ability to display a recipe (optional - all)
6. Ability to delete a recipe from recipes
7. Ability to delete an ingredient from current ingredients
8. A _matching_ function which matches current ingredients to a recipe's
   ingredients and outputs highest match

9. Ability to reset password if forgotten it
10. Scrape the web for better matching results

**Note: 7-8 are optional.**

## Progress check-in

## Iteration 1: Test Driven Development

### Task

In this iteration, you are expected to:

1. Create tests for all of the functions in the agreed upon interface.

   These should all be in files of the formn `*_test.js`. See below for more information.

2. Write assumptions that you feel you are making in your interpretation of the specification and of the functions provided.

   Write these in markdown in `assumptions.md`.

We are **not** expected to begin developing or completing the actual functions themselves as of yet.

The first iteration does not include all capabilities. Further capabilities will be introduced in subsequent iterations.

The `assumptions.md` file described above should be in the root of your repository. If you've not written markdown before (which we assume most of you haven't), it's not necessary to research the format. Markdown is essentially plain text with a few extra features for basic formatting. You can just stick with plain text if you find that easier.
